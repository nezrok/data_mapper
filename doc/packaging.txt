Packaging
===============================================================================

In order to be able to use absolute import paths on intra-package referencing,
it is good practice to implement a package.
For that, we created data_mapper/setup.py and ran pip3 install -e data_mapper.
By adding the -e flag to the pip install command a symlink to the source files
is installed instead to the byte-code compiled source, so there is no need to 
re-install the package on any changes (if I've understood it correctly).
